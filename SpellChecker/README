Design of SpellChecker

*****IDE Usage*****
Please note that I use IntelliJ IDEA, not eclipse. For some reason, on my IntelliJ, to check the miss spelled
and the dictionary to use, it only recognized the file if I didn't include the .txt extension at the end of the file.
I think I might have to install a pluggin of some sort. But if you are running the code on eclipse or any IDEA, just
be aware that you might have to include the .txt extension or might not. Just try both, just in case.

****To Run The Program****
Main method is located in SpellCheckerRunner class

***Input Parameters***
To update the dictionary used: go to SpellChecker -> line20 and line121
To update the parameters used (n, commonPercent, topN): go to SpellChecker -> line 81

**Design Principles**
I decided to use a similar format to blackjacksolitaire in the sence to have a userinterface,
main method class and separate classes for different functionality of the program. The three
main files are FileHandler, SpellChecker, and WordRecommender. In my WordRecommender class,
in my getLeftSimilarity and getRightSimilarity methods there is repeated code between them
that I created a method for the repeated code and used it. But when I would run the tests on
codio, it was failing both the getSimilarity tests, so I changed it back with the repeated code.
I am not sure why the tests were failing since my code still worked find once I implemented the
DRY principle.

One design change would be using the Scanner to request the parameters for WordRecommmender instead
of the user having to change the parameters in the code itself.

*Bugs In Code*
There is a bug in my code, for when the user selects 'r' for replace and then selects a number for the
replacement word. The code displays "Sorry, please enter a valid command" but the code still performs correctly.
The functionality works and it's not breaking the code but it just displays that message.
